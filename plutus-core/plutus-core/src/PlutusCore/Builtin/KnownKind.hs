-- @Typeable@ information for the Haskell kind of a type and so we could just keep it around
-- (instead of throwing it away like we do now) and compute the Plutus kind directly from that.
-- That might be less efficient and probably requires updating the Plutus Tx compiler, so we went
-- with the simplest option for now and it's to have a class. Providing an instance per universe is
-- no big deal.
